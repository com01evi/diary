What help to construct a good habit are joy to grow, joy to proceed, joy to learn.
The more I learn new things, the more I want to know what I don't.
I keep taking a effort to become a great thinker, investor and coder, which is my dream.

If I keep learning smart contaracts I will know how to write contracts that contract with society and make a profit. If I keep reading books I build principal of knowledge that help me insight better. If I keep learning blockchain I will be able to invest properly. If I keep leanring data science I will aquire ability to see the world through the open data. If I keep learning self-improvement, I could improve my cognitive skills.

It's fun to imagine being able to data science and code smart contracts and insight social activity.
