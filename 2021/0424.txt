Even if ETH price won't go up to $10k and keep current price, I can earn $2000 per year with Hashhub lending.
And I think ETH will hit $20k this year, so I will earn $10k with Hashhub lending and ETH price won't go back under $10k, I will be able to earn over $5000 steadly with this strategy.
Keep the habits, go forward
