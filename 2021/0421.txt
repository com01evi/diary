I might be able to earn money without working thanks to DeFi.
Keep the habits to become the person I want to be.
In addition to current habits, I will start learning DeFi.
By Augast I decide my DeFi strategy and will start earning with it.
If ETH price go above $10k and will not go down, I won't have to work anymore.
But there is a risk that ETH will go down or won't go up even once and it'll likely happpen.
So I need a decent job to earn money.
Research and keep following markets which I am interested in.
How can I earn money while I cannot be an investor?
