build something valuable, publish it and connect the people around the world.
The longer I make sentenses, the better my memory becomes.
Don't read to memorize but to think and to understand.
I wanna be a man who can analyse how the world are changing and will change.
In the night, it's time to explore math world, tinker with mathematical equations and think about what I learned.
Know how to love whatever/whoever you want to. You will never regret.
